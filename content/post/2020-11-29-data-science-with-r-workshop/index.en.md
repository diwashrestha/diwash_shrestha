[RNepal](https://www.facebook.com/RUGNepal/) and [Kathfest](https://www.facebook.com/kathfest/) collaborated to organize the 3 days “Data Science with R” workshop. This workshop was held in [Kathford Engineering College](https://kathford.edu.np/) on occasion of the [Kathfest 2019](https://twitter.com/kathfest).

### Introduction

 There were 15 participants from the kathford college studying bachelor in computer engineering. I talked about data Science, steps and skills needed to do data science.

### Day 1

In day 1 I talked about the What is Data Science, How to do Data Science. I taught participants about R language, extract Data in R environment. Participants learned about the data cleaning process, data manipulation with [tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/), [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) package.
