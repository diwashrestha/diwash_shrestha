Hello! üôè üëã 

I am Diwash Shrestha, a data scientist passionate about driving meaningful business outcomes through analytics and machine learning. With three years of experience, I specialize in solving complex problems, providing understandable insights, and offering tech solutions.

Throughout my career, I have gained extensive analytics expertise in diverse industries like security/survillance, healthcare tech, and education tech. This varied background has sharpened my analytical skills and provided me with a unique perspective that enables me to navigate and excel in a variety of domains.

Aside from my professional interests, I like to explore historical narratives, play üïπÔ∏è RPG and Strategy video games.

On this site, I keep a list of my projects, presentations and what I have learned through my blog.
