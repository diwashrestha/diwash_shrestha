I am Data Scientist at Reduct Nepal, Transcription and Translation company. I am also a Educator and Co-Founder of [RNepal Community ](https://www.facebook.com/RUGNepal), Gold [Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador](https://studentambassadors.microsoft.com/) and Microsoft Innovative Educator.


I like to process data and share the knowledge and insights using visualization, infographics and web application. My area of specialty is data analysis, data visualization and data-driven software development. I do quite a bit of community work and public speaking, you can find me in Kathmandu organizing and participating in community tech events.
